# Flights

This project is an implementation to find the shortest route between two airports in terms of:

* Time
* Distance
* Price
* Schedule


The algorithms used to make the implementation where:

* [k shortest path routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_shortest_path_routing)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
